## 📋 **HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM**

### 🎯 **STEP 1: Place Consumer Report**
Place your consumer credit report (PDF format) anywhere in the `consumerreport/` directory or subdirectories:
```
consumerreport/
├── input/
│   ├── Experian.pdf      # Works in subdirectories
│   ├── Equifax.pdf       # Works in subdirectories  
│   └── TransUnion.pdf    # Works in subdirectories
├── MyReport.pdf          # Works in main directory
└── Any_Name.pdf          # Any filename works!
```
**✨ NEW: System automatically finds ANY PDF file in consumerreport/ folder!**

### 🔍 **STEP 2: Generate Dispute Letter**
Run the main analysis script:
```bash
python extract_account_details.py
```

**✨ NEW: Smart Workspace Cleanup**
The system automatically checks for existing files and offers cleanup options:
- 🗑️ **Clean All** - Fresh start (delete all old files)
- 🎯 **Smart Clean** - Keep only latest files per bureau [RECOMMENDED]
- 📅 **Date Clean** - Remove files older than 7 days
- ❌ **Keep All** - Continue with existing files

**What This Does:**
- ✅ **Smart cleanup** prevents file conflicts and confusion
- ✅ **Extracts text** from your PDF consumer report
- ✅ **Identifies negative items** (collections, late payments, charge-offs)
- ✅ **Searches knowledgebase** for proven deletion strategies  
- ✅ **Generates ultimate deletion demand letter** with legal citations
- ✅ **Creates organized folders** per bureau in `outputletter/` directory

### ✏️ **STEP 3: Create Editable Text File**
Convert to editable format so you can customize:
```bash
python convert_to_professional_pdf.py
```

**Output:** `outputletter/[BUREAU]/EDITABLE_DISPUTE_LETTER_[NAME]_[DATE].txt`

**Edit this file to:**
- Replace `[YOUR NAME]` with your real information
- Replace `[YOUR ADDRESS]` with your complete address
- Add any additional content you want
- Customize account details as needed
- Review all legal sections

### 📄 **STEP 4: Convert to Professional PDF**
After editing the text file, create the final mailable PDF:
```bash
python convert_to_professional_pdf.py pdf
```

**Output:** `outputletter/PROFESSIONAL_DELETION_DEMAND_[NAME]_[DATE].pdf`

**PDF Features:**
- ✅ **Professional business letter format**
- ✅ **All emojis removed** for serious business appearance
- ✅ **Standard margins** and typography
- ✅ **Proper signature blocks** and contact information
- ✅ **Legal citations preserved** (FCRA, FDCPA, Metro 2)
