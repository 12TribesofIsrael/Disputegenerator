## üîå **BACKEND INTEGRATION (Mock for Now)**

Since you're building the frontend, create **mock API responses** for:

### **POST /api/upload**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "fileId": "abc123",
  "fileName": "Experian_Report.pdf"
}
```

### **POST /api/analyze** 
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "currentRound": 1,
  "negativeItems": [
    "[CREDIT CARD] - Charge Off (FDCPA violations)",
    "[STUDENT LOAN SERVICER] - Late Payment (Federal compliance)",
    "[BANK NAME] - Late Payment"
  ],
  "potentialDamages": {
    "minimum": 7400,
    "maximum": 14300,
    "roundMultiplier": 1.0
  },
  "strategiesApplied": [
    "Request for Procedure (FCRA ¬ß1681i)",
    "Method of Verification (10 questions)",
    "Account-specific FDCPA targeting",
    "Student loan federal compliance"
  ],
  "letterContent": "# ROUND 1 - DEMAND FOR DELETION...",
  "consumerName": "[CONSUMER NAME]"
}
```

### **POST /api/generate-pdf**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "pdfUrl": "/mock-pdf-download",
  "fileName": "ROUND_1_DELETION_DEMAND_[Consumer_Name]_2025-08-05.pdf",
  "roundNumber": 1,
